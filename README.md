# CloudDashboard-LAMP Project

Welcome to the CloudDashboard-LAMP project repository! This project showcases the creation of a web-based dashboard application powered by a LAMP stack, hosted on Linode. Below are the steps to set up your development environment.

## Linode Instance and LAMP Stack Setup

1. **Linode Instance Provisioning:**
   - Log in to your Linode account and create a new Linode instance.
   - Note down the IP address of your Linode instance for future reference.

2. **SSH Access:**
   - Open your terminal and connect to your Linode instance using SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh username@your_linode_ip
     ```

3. **Update and Upgrade:**
   - Update package repositories and upgrade installed packages:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade
     ```

4. **Apache2 Installation:**
   - Install the Apache web server:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install apache2
     ```

5. **MySQL Server Installation:**
   - Install the MySQL server package and follow the prompts for secure installation:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install mysql-server
     mysql_secure_installation
     ```

6. **PHP and Modules Installation:**
   - Install PHP and required modules:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
     ```

7. **Verify LAMP Stack:**
   - To verify the LAMP stack installation, create a `phpinfo.php` file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
     ```
     Add the following lines to the file:
     ```php
     <?php
     phpinfo();
     ?>
     ```
     Save and exit. Access this page in your web browser by visiting `http://your_linode_ip/phpinfo.php`.

8. **Cleanup:**
   - Remove the `phpinfo.php` file:
     ```bash
     sudo rm /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
     ```

9. **Additional Configuration:**
   - Customize Apache virtual hosts, MySQL configurations, and PHP settings according to your project's requirements.

10. **Commit Changes:**
    - Navigate to your local repository directory and commit your changes:
      ```bash
      git add README.md
      git commit -m "Added Linode instance setup and LAMP stack installation instructions."
      git push origin master
      ```
